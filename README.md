# Video-Game-Sales-Regression
For this project I pulled a data set from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales. This data set contains 16,599 video game titles sold from 1980 to 2017 and contains the following information for each title:

* Rank - Ranking of overall sales

* Name - The games name

* Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)

* Year - Year of the game's release

* Genre - Genre of the game

* Publisher - Publisher of the game

* NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions)

* EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)

* JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)

* Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)

* Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales.

For my linear regression model I decided to use the global sales and year variables to see if the year has an impact on the number of games sold globally.
